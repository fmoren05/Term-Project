# Term Project
 
Our turret design for the ME 405 term project features a dynamic combination of a lazy susan mechanism for horizontal panning and an adjustable firing angle mechanism, complemented by integrated flywheels to assist in launching projectiles. This setup enables autonomous target acquisition, aiming, and firing control on a Nerfâ„¢ or similar projectile launcher within the specified dimensional constraints. With safety considerations and adherence to project guidelines in mind, our turret system aims to achieve precise and efficient performance in dueling scenarios.
