# Term Project
Introduction: 

Our turret design for the ME 405 term project features a dynamic combination of a lazy susan mechanism for horizontal panning and an adjustable firing angle mechanism, complemented by integrated flywheels to assist in launching projectiles. This setup enables autonomous target acquisition, aiming, and firing control on a Nerfâ„¢ or similar projectile launcher within the specified dimensional constraints. With safety considerations and adherence to project guidelines in mind, our turret system aims to achieve precise and efficient performance in dueling scenarios. As a result, this final turret design will be used to compete in 1v1 battles with other groups to determine who can hit their target first over the span of 5 rounds. 

#Hardware Design: 

Key Components

Microcontroller: Utilizes a microcontroller for running the control algorithms and managing task scheduling. Common choices include STM32, Arduino, or similar platforms.

Motor Driver: Incorporates motor driver circuits for driving the motors. These drivers provide the necessary power and control signals for motor operation.

Encoders: Utilizes rotary encoders for providing feedback on motor position. These sensors ensure accurate positioning and enable closed-loop control.

Sensors: May include additional sensors for environment monitoring or feedback, depending on the application requirements.
Peripheral Devices: Interfaces with peripheral devices such as cameras, temperature sensors, or other actuators for expanded functionality.
